whenever we have to pass the query parameter to JSP then we have to use the model.
In production, we should set the logging to info
Req accept -> Dispatcher servlet -> identifies the correct controller method ->
-> execute the controller method -> viewResolver find the correct view -> return HTTP response

Request vs session vs model
model - whenever we put anything in the model be default it will only be available for particular scope of request.
session - @SessionAttributes need to put this in every controller. it takes additional memory bcz it stored on server.
